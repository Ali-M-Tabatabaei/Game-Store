#Game-Store
project info:

This project was written for the database course in Ferdowsi Universty of Mashhad.
In this project, first we have been told to draw the ER model and tables required for a store's database.
And in the second phase, we wrote the required queries according to the mentioned operations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Languages used in this project:

We used MySQL to write queries. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system and
it use to add, access, and also process data stored in a computer database.
MySQL provides data protection features, data encryption, SSH and SSL support. There are also mechanisms to restrict server access and block users.
For Front-End we used html and css. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content, 
and allows users to create and structure sections, headings, links, paragraphs, and more, on a website using various tags and elements.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text.
Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics.
For Back-End we used Flask. Flask is a web framework, it's a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily.
Advantages of using Flask framework are:

    >There is a built-in development server and a fast debugger provided.
    >Lightweight
    >Secure cookies are supported.
    >Templating using Jinja2.
    >Request dispatching using REST.
    >Support for unit testing is built-in.
